 - God's original intention is that we would express and represent Him -> Genesis 1:26
 
 - God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. 2:4) 
   - What is truth? John 17:17 -> Your word is truth
   - John 1:1 -> The Word is God -> The Lord is the Word
   - God desires al men to come to the full knowledge of Him
