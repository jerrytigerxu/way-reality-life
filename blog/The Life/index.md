- What are the many negative things that keep us from pursuing the Lord and fulfilling His eternal purpose?
	- the world (lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, vainglory of life) -> handcrafted by Satan to capture us by taking advantage of what is within us
		- provision, protection, entertainment
		- lust of the eyes can also refer to lust of the heart (because eyes and heart are very related in the Bible)
	- religion and the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and idols
	- the flesh
		- living by the body and the desires of the body
			- food
			- sleep
			- pleasure
	- the soul-life
		- living by the parts of our soul
			- mind
			- emotion
			- will
		- the self
			- we seek self-glory and self-exaltation
