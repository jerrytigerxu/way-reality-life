title: Things We Should Not Live By

  As Christians, we all have the responsibility to live out Christ. The apostle Paul said himself that "to live is Christ" (Philippians 1:21) and that it's "no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20) Only when we let the life that is in our spirit live itself out are we truly an overcoming and rejoicing people. There is nothing sweeter than living a life of oneness with our dear Lord Jesus (Psalms 133)!
  
  We've all heard this before, and a good number of Christians have experienced this to some extent. I wonder though, how many of us realize the full extent of how crucial it is for us to live by the spirit and not by anything else? Have we seen just how dangerous it is for us to live by anything other than the Spirit in our spirit? Have we experienced just how grave and sobering this matter is?
  
  If we consider the components of our human being, the parts that make up who we are, we can see a bunch of "being parts" that we could potentially (or already) live by. (When I say "live by", I mean that the feelings or desires within a specific part of our being is what causes us to do certain actions or make certain decisions). What's interesting is that there are differing "levels of badness" that come out from living by these parts of our being. Let's list them out.
  
  #### the flesh 
  Living by the flesh is obviously the worst thing you can live by. We've seen from Genesis, during the days of Noah, mankind was full of violence and completely living for themselves and doing every wicked thing (Genesis 6). The reason why mankind lived this way is because there was nothing governing them. Man had left God (Genesis 4:16) and completely disregarded His speaking and the feeling of their conscience, and since there was no law yet, humans lived completely according to the feelings and desires of their fallen human body, their flesh (Romans 1:18-32). Even some unbelievers feel that it's not good to live this way, and that's saying something!
  
  Practically speaking, living by the flesh means to live by the natural desires that come about in our mortal bodies. Many of these desires are created by God, so intrinsically they are good and even holy, but many times we indulge these desires and go way beyond what is normal. What are these desires? These are seemingly normal things like eating, drinking, sleeping, sex, social interaction, physical activity. All of these things are normal and absolutely God-made, but it's extremely dangerous if we LIVE for these things and live by these natural desires, because Satan has corrupted our bodies and formed the flesh, so it's so easy for us to fall into the trap of indulgence and excess. 
  
  What happens if we live by our flesh? Simple. We lead a life of sin and even of idolatry. We sow unrest and chaos and cause damage wherever we go, especially when it comes to matters of God. We become slothful and lazy and useless to everyone, even Satan himself. 
  
  We need to ask for God's mercy and grace that we would not live according to our flesh.
  
  
  #### the will
  
  To live according to our will means that we always want to be in control. We don't like being told what to do and we especially don't want to be obedient to anyone. This is the exact opposite of the life the Lord Jesus lived on this Earth. He was a Man so meek and so gentle, always seeking the will of the Father and not His own will (John 5:30). 
  
  Living by the will causes us to be rebellious and impossible to correct or adjust. It causes us to take pleasure in disobeying authority and closing our ears to any of the healthy teaching. Because the Lord clearly shows us in Deuteronomy 28 that blessing always follows our obedience to Him and that curse follows our disobedience, it is crucial that we don't remain rebellious toward Him. 
  
  There have been many examples of severe damage done to the Lord's work and move on this Earth because of people who rebelled against the people God set as the deputy authorities. To rebel against those whom God has set as the spiritual (or earthly) authority is to rebel against God Himself. Let us not strive to be rebellious and stubborn-willed, but rather realize that the Lord's heart is always good toward us.
  
  
  #### the emotion
  
  This is a big one. I would argue that most people actually live by their emotions. It's pretty obvious what it means to live according to our emotions. If I feel angry, I treat people harshly. If I feel sad, I withdraw from others. If I feel happy, I treat everyone well. If I feel like doing something, I'll do it. If I don't feel like doing something, I won't do it. Do you see how this can easily be exploited by the enemy? It's easy to forget that the feelings of our emotions are just that, feelings. They are sensations from within, as opposed to sensations of our bodies. If you knew that scratching a part of your body would lead to part of your skin to be damaged, would you scratch it? We are not our feelings, and knowing this helps us realize we don't have to be bound by our emotions.
  
  The Lord's example shows us that how we feel should not control our actions. Even though He must have experienced countless disappointments and times of suffering, He never once strayed away from the Father's will. Let me be clear, it's OKAY to feel certain things. Paul clearly says "be angry, yet do not sin" (Ephesians 4:26). It's okay to feel anger, but that anger doesn't have to drive you to yell at your spouse or kid. When the feelings come, it is better to simply [release them to the Lord](https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/way-reality-life/blob/master/blog/The%20Life/Commit%20All%20To%20Him.md) instead of potentially hurting other people.
  
  Living by the emotion is extremely deadly, as it causes us to be very inconsistent and unreliable. One moment we are strong, the next we are cowardly. One moment we treat people with kindness, the next, with malice. When we live by our emotion, it's easy for us to mislead others and even cause serious damage. It can argued that many mental disorders came about because of lack of proper care and because of emotional scars that were inflicted.
  
  Only by the Lord's mercy can we choose not to live by our emotions. This is the true definition of denying the self.
  
  
  #### the mind
  
  Living by the mind is probably just as prevalent as living by the emotion. It's important to note that as humans we don't tend to live by only ONE of the parts of our being. We could live by multiple, or even all of them, and maybe at differing time periods and frequencies. To live by the mind means that everything has to make sense, be logical, be understandable. When you live by the mind, you are governed by the thoughts that roll into your brain. If you believe something is right, you will stick by that thought even at the expense of understanding others or doing anything that you don't agree with. This is what it means to be subjective, to always insist on your own opinions and your own beliefs. You always have to be right, and if people don't agree with you, you insist they have to be wrong. 
  
  Living by the mind makes it impossible for you to consider God's will and follow the Lord's leading. It causes you to be a terrible listener and absolutely useless in comforting or exhorting others, something that is essential in order to serve the Lord.

  There are many things that we can do apart from the Lord, but almost all of them can be encapsulated in these aspects of our being that we could live by.
