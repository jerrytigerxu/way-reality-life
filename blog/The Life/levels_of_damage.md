title: Things We Should Not Live By

  As Christians, we all agree that we need to live out Christ. The apostle Paul said himself that "to live is Christ" (Philippians 1:21) and that it's "no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20) Only when we let the life that is in our spirit live itself out are we truly an overcoming and rejoicing people. There is nothing sweeter than living a life of oneness with our dear Lord Jesus!
  
  We've all heard this before, and a good number of believers have experienced to some extent. I wonder though, how many of us realize the full extent of how crucial it is for us to live by the spirit and not by anything else? Have we seen just how dangerous it is for us to live by anything other than the Spirit in our spirit? Have we experienced just how grave and sobering this matter is?
