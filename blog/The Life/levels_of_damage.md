  As Christians, we all agree that we need to live out Christ. The apostle Paul said himself that "to live is Christ" (Philippians 1:21) and that it's "no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20) Only when we let the life that is in our spirit live itself out are we truly an overcoming and rejoicing people. There is nothing sweeter than living a life of oneness with our dear Lord Jesus!
  
  We've all heard this before, and a good number of believers have experienced to some extent. I wonder though, how many of us realize the full extent of how crucial it is for us to live by the spirit and not by anything else? Have we seen just how dangerous it is for us to live by anything other than the Spirit in our spirit? Have we experienced just how grave and sobering this matter is?
  
  If we consider the components of our human being, the parts that make up who we are, we can see a bunch of "being parts" that we could potentially (or already) live by. (When I say "live by", I mean that the feelings or desires within a specific part of our being is what causes us to do certain actions or make certain decisions). What's interesting is that there are differing "levels of badness" that come from living by these parts of our being. Let's list them out.
  
  #### the flesh 
  Living by the flesh is obviously the worst thing you can live by.
  
  
  
  #### the will
  
  
  #### the emotion
  
  
  
  #### the mind
