# Denying the self for the Lord's sake
 * You need to be trained in the matter of handling your natural being (your body & soul)
 
## Why do we deny the self? (Take up the cross)
 * To carry out God's purpose
 * We soon realize that the biggest barrier to living out Christ is **ourselves**
   * Why do we want to?
      * Because we love the Lord and give ourselves to Him and want to serve Him 
          * This love is imparted from Him, through His cherishing and nourishing
   * How do we deny the self?
      * Resurrection power + our cooperation + "small effort"
## Practically denying the self
* "I will not be brought under the power of anything"
* Body
   * "buffet your body and make it your slave"
   * choosing not to live my fleshly desires (yet still taking care of yourselves)
     * food, sexual desires, sleep, laziness, passive entertainment
* Soul
  * Emotion
    * Releasing everything to the Lord
  * Mind
    * Learning to clear mind and consider God's thoughts
  * Will
     * being subdued to listen and obey authority
