# You can't enjoy without experiencing

* Experience is in the spirit; enjoyment is in the soul
* You can experience something yet not enjoy it (Example: food you don't like)
* You can experience the killing of the cross, but we can go further and even enjoy it (Example: being limited by people and/or environment -> experience of wheat and barley)
* Many Christians experience things from the Lord, but very few enjoy it
* What could possibly cause us to be open and subdued? 
  * Only a clear seeing of Him and a heart that is just burning for Him
    * We have to allow Him to serve us and care for us so we can touch *how much* He loves us
