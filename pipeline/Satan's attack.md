# Satan's attack throughout the ages

 - **What Satan attacks, that's what he's scared of**
   - Satan opposes God's economy & God's heart, which is Christ and the church
   - Satan specifically opposes Christ being everything to man, and the church expressing God and having His authority
 - God wants to be everything to man (to head up all things in Christ), so that He can gain the church, His bride, who will be the one to execute His judgment on Satan
