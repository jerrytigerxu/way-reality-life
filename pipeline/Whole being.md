# How do you practically set your whole being on the Lord? (Mark 12:30)
* What are the components of our being? 
* We have seven main components
  * Body
  * Mind
  * Emotion
  * Will
  * Conscience
  * Fellowship
  * Intuition
* Body
  * We can give our time and energy and even physical effort (going to meetings)
* Mind
  * We can consider the things of God and allow our mind to be renewed
* Emotion
  * We are full of love and appreciation for Him and we have His feeling regarding the church, mankind, and the world
* Will
  * We are subdued by Him and choose His will for us and we choose what He chooses
* Spirit
  * We constantly exercise our parts of our spirit (conscience, fellowship, intuition) and follow the anointing
