# Psychological preventative care = the humanity of Jesus

* Any health issues (bios, psuche, zoe) comes from anything outside of what is normal and balanced
  * Too much or too little of anything 
* Psychological problems (mental health) stem from people being denied their core needs (example of dog in cage)
  * The core needs
    * Appreciation
    * Full expression of soul, especially emotions
    * Family
    * Social life
    * Body needs
    * Self-fulfillment
    * Pleasure
    * Healthy stress
    * Protection
* Everything we need is given by the humanity of Jesus
