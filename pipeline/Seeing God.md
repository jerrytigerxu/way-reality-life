### God is light, so when we contact God in our spirit, there should be much shining

## 2 traps
 * Introspection/self-loathing
   * trying to examine your self without God
   * Beating yourself up and being consumed with self-hatred
 * Obsession & pride
   * Thinking you have no problems and insisting you are following the Lord's speaking when you clearly aren't
## God's View
 * God loves us and is for us. He will never condemn us harshly, rather He reveals and points out things contrary to Him gently
 * There should be the revelation of sins and cold heart, leading us to repentance
 * The Lord is specific and gentle, not general and harsh
