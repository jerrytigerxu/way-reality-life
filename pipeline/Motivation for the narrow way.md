# What is the motivation for taking the narrow way?
* Think about marriage. Is it not a constraining? Is it not a narrow way? 
  * Reminds me of Drake's candy analogy in Drake & Josh
  
* How limiting it is to join yourself to one person when there are so many "fish in the sea"
* What's the only thing that could motivate us to live with one person for the rest of our lives?
  * **LOVE** (I can relate to this very much now)
  * Not merely youthful infatuation (or God forbid, lust), but real, genuine love
* If we're not willing to drop everything for the Lord, that's a clear sign our love for Him is shallow and short
