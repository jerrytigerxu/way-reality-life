# Application of the story of the ten lepers (Luke 17)
* God doesn't want to solve our problems (that's too low of a goal); He wants to restore us to His original intention, that He would be everything to us
* The Lord loves us, so He wants us to be happy. Sometimes He will bless us in the material realm
* Many times He is willing to allow us to pass through trials and tests now so that we will gain something eternal
  * "Momentary lightness of affliction -> eternal weight of glory"
  * What is suffering now compared to eternity?


### The Lord takes our prayers seriously
* When you give yourslef to Him, He will then proceed to give us the experiences we "asked" for
* With the consecration comes the spiritual blessings (Nazarite vow)
