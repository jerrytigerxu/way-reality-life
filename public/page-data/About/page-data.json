We need to constantly be brought back to God and to God's heart, and the only way we can know God and His heart is through His Word, the Bible.  </p>\n<h1>An Overview of the Complete Divine Revelation in God's Word</h1>\n<p>The central line of the entire Bible is simply that the Triune God became a man so that man might become the corporate God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, to build up the Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem. Jesus Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God fully accomplished everything on God's heart through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. God has fully accomplished everything for us and we are awaiting and longing for the Lord's second coming, yet in order for Him to return He needs our cooperation today.</p>\n<h2>How Can We Cooperate With The Lord Today?</h2>\n<p>The Lord tells us in John 14:6 that He is \"the way and the reality and the life\".</p>\n<p><strong>Reality</strong> - We need to know Him in the Word as the reality of all things by being constituted with the truth according to the Scriptures so we can see the vision of God's economy and the vision of the age. We need to really see the person and work of Christ and see the complete central line of the truth (the Word, the Triune God, God's economy, the all-inclusive Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the Body of Christ, the New Jerusalem). </p>\n<p><strong>Life</strong> - We need to experience Christ as life to grow up into Him as the Head in all things. </p>\n<p><strong>Way</strong> - We need to follow the leading of the Head to function in His Body and to carry out His ministry and His work, which is simply the God-ordained way for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/About/","breadcrumb":{"location":"/About/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/About/","crumbLabel":"About"}]}}}}
