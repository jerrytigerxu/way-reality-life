If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Lord sternly charges us not to love the world nor the things that make up, or comprise, the world. </li>\n<li>If we love the world, there is no room in us to love the Lord. Our heart has limited space, and there is no such thing as compromise when it comes to Satan's kingdom. Either we love Satan's kingdom or we love God's kingdom, there is no balance.</li>\n<li>One very important principle is to understand that many of the things that are in the world, like industry or entertainment or culture, are not inherently bad. In fact, many of these things are necessities (times of Noah when people were eating and drinking... -> the problem isn't the necessities, but the fact that people were distracted from the fact that the flood was coming) and are even good, but God has placed within all of us these desires and needs, so there is the normal set amount for everything. It's only when we deviate from what is ordained by God, either having little or too much of anything, when problems arise.</li>\n<li>The term \"world\" is used several times in the Bible, and the English word has multiple meanings behind it -> \"cosmos\", God-created planet, John 3:16 -> the people on the Earth</li>\n<li>Satan has created this \"cosmos\", a system that ensnares us and keeps us away from the Lord's purpose</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>origin of the world</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Cain -> leaving the presence of God (because of his denying God's ordained way and then killing his brother out of jealousy) and having to fend for himself -> cities were made</li>\n<li>Jabal -> provision and living</li>\n<li>Jubal -> entertainment</li>\n<li>Tubal-cain -> protection</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>lust of the flesh</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>food</li>\n<li>sex</li>\n<li>sleep</li>\n<li>any form of satisfaction and pleasure</li>\n<li>when you go too far -> adrenaline and dopamine -> drugs and alcohol -> beyond God-made desires</li>\n<li>warmth of social interaction -> leads to gossip and putting down others</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>lust of the eyes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>entertainment, things that occupy our time</li>\n<li>media and content and technology</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>vainglory of life</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>ambition, pride, self-exaltation, the self, desire to be glorified by men</li>\n<li>this is what SO MANY people are driven by today -> the desire to be famous or well-known or wealthy to be glorified by others</li>\n<li>even just keeping up on social media is driven by this</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>what we can do as Christians today</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>many things in the world are not inherently bad, but they distract us from God's purpose instead of helping us</li>\n<li>ultimately when we love the world, our lives are filled with anxiety and unrest and frustration and pain and suffering</li>\n<li>Matthew 6:33 -> seek FIRST the kingdom of God -> aim at the Lord's interest first and all of your necessities will be taken care of</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is the world?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/The Reality/What is the world/","breadcrumb":{"location":"/The Reality/What is the world/","crumbs":[{"pathname":"/","crumbLabel":"Home"},{"pathname":"/The Reality/","crumbLabel":"The Reality"},{"pathname":"/The Reality/What is the world/","crumbLabel":"What is the world"}]}}}}
