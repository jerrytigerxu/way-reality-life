It's His will that we would be conformed to His image (Genesis 1:26, Colossians).The Bible clearly teaches that an important\nresult of seeing the Lord and receiving His shining is the revelation of our true condition. [Job abhorring himself, wretched man that I am, Isaiah unclean lips).</p>\n<p>As Christians, our responsibility is not to try to be some perfect, holy, good person. The Lord is not looking for people who are simply good and proper, He is looking for people who would match Him in life and nature and expression! The only way the Lord can do this is to add more of His element into us day by day. Through this process of spending time with Him and Him exposing the lack within us, we can clearly see that our very being is contrary to Him (Romans 7). The Lord\nwants to do something in us, yet He will not infringe on our free will, and there are elements in us that simply refuse to do what the Lord wants.</p>\n<h3>common issues</h3>\n<p>Let's get extremely practical. Suppose the Lord wants to transform you in your relationship with your parents. This is a common ailment of not just believers, but\nhuman beings in general. The Lord might show you that the way you talk and interact with your parents does not match Him. The incarnated Jesus, when he was only\ntwelve years old, is such a pattern to us (Luke 2). The Lord doesn't want us to force ourselves to submit to our parents or to put on a show. There is no genuineness there and the Lord is always displeased when we try to do His will without relying on Him as our source for doing it. </p>\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles to having a proper relationship with our parents is <a href=\"https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/way-reality-life/blob/master/blog/The%20Life/Levels%20of%20damage.md\">our wild emotion</a>. The emotion is very difficult to tame and it is the source of\ncountless problems among mankind today. Too many people make decisions purely based on how they feel. This allows them to be easily manipulated by Satan. If we give a bad attitude when we feel annoyance or we straight up yell when we feel anger, how will we ever be able to have peace with our folks? Do we choose to take certain actions based on the feelings of our soul or from the voice coming from our spirit? When your Mom is nagging you to take out the trash or your Dad is giving you a hard time about your grades, what do you when the Lord is clearly leading you to not talk back or give an attitude yet there is the burning sensation of anger welling up within you like an itch that absolutely must be scratched? </p>\n<p>The secret is to commit everything to Him. The Lord Himself committed everything to the Father (1 Peter 2:23) when He was suffering and facing persecution. </p>\n<h3>practical application</h3>\n<p>This is very practical. You first need to develop the sense of what you are actually feeling in your emotion, then you can give that feeling to the Lord by saying\n\"Lord, I give you my [whatever emotion you are feeling]. I'm about to [do some action that you know is not right], but Lord, I give this feeling to you\". If you\ncan have this short prayer everytime you experience negative emotions, you will find that there is a weight that is lifted off your shoulders and life and peace\nwill flow in. </p>\n<p>Ideally, you would pray this to the Lord out loud, but if you are in a situation where that's not feasible (like when someone is confronting you directly), you\nwhisper it to the Lord or pray it in your mind. When you're alone, you are free to do whatever it takes to fully release. When I get really angry, I have several\nthings I can do. I can find some soft objects like my pillow that I can punch. I can do lots of push-ups or situps to release. I can go into my car and scream and yell and call on the Lord's name. When I'm feeling really sad, I make sure to have some time to myself and I'll shed tears to release my feeling. Don't ever be afraid that the Lord doesn't want to hear your negativity. He can handle it. He's God, so whatever negativity you throw at Him will simply be burned up,\nallowing Him to infuse more peace and joy into you. The more you practice committing everything to the Lord, the more you find that you can stop living according to your soulish feelings. You can make choices that align with <a href=\"https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/way-reality-life/blob/master/blog/The%20Life/Resolve%20to%20do%20His%20will.md\">the Lord's will</a>.</p>\n<p>You will find that your experience of the Lord as peace and joy will enhanced as you really practice giving Him everything in your soul and allowing Him to fill you with His sweet presence and essence.</p>"}
