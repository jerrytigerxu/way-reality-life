This is quite common among kids who grow up in Christian homes. These little ones ask God to give them food, video games, fame, fortune, and other attractive things, and when they don't receive an answer from God, they immediately lose their faith in God. Let's not pick on children too much though, because this is a scenario that is seen among older people as well. For example, when I was a senior in high school, I prayed to the Lord regarding which college I should go to. I had my preferences and I had my safety schools. Guess what? I didn't get a clear answer right away, no matter how much I prayed. Does that mean that God doesn't care? Should I just renounce my faith in Him? Of course not! Let's not be so shallow regarding God's heart toward us.</p>\n<p>  In John 7:17, the Lord Jesus Himself said: \"If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.\" This is a classic promise with a prerequisite. We can know whether or not something is of God only if we resolve to do His will. Jeremiah 29:13 says something very similar: \"And you will seek Me and find Me if you search for Me with all your heart.\" God will only open up His heart to us if we seek Him with our heart. Isn't this principle clearly seen even in our regular human interactions? Even in business, I wouldn't want to partner with someone who isn't fully invested in our partnership. If someone wants to gain something from me, yet is unwilling to give anything in return, why would I give this person anything? The best example of the Lord's principle, however, is in romantic relationships. If I truly love someone, I care about what she cares about. Relationships are a two-way street. You need to give in order to get. If I only care about what I get out of this relationship, this relationship isn't stable or strong. </p>\n<p>  [sdflkjsdfs]</p>\n<p>  The sequence (or cycle) that we need to constantly be in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are attracted to the Lord (through His Word or through other saints)</li>\n<li>We give ourselves to Him and resolve to do His will</li>\n<li>We learn more about ourselves in His light and abhor ourselves</li>\n<li>We depend on Him and He adds more of His element to us</li>\n<li>Repeat</li>\n</ul>"}
