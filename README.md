**John 14:6**: "Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me."



## Contents

 - [The Way](https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/way-reality-life/tree/master/blog/The%20Way) - how we as believers can practically carry out the Lord's will on Earth today, which is His eternal economy (how to serve Him -> gospel preaching and shepherding)
 - [The Reality](https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/way-reality-life/tree/master/blog/The%20Reality) - appreciating and enjoying the Lord for everything He has accomplished (Eternity past, OT, NT, church history), everything He is, and everything He is still doing and will do
 - [The Life](https://github.com/jerrytigerxu/way-reality-life/tree/master/blog/The%20Life) - knowing and experiencing the divine life which is in our spirit (depending on Him, words of warning)
