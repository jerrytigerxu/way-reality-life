# Issue

 - Trying to recreate the blog page structure from https://joshuatz.com/posts/2019/gatsby-automatic-directory-listing-pages-beginners-attempt/
   - Having multiple sub-folders within the programmatic page structure 
 - All of the slugs and individual markdown pages are formed
 - For some reason, the index directory pages aren't being generated even though they are clearly recognized by the program
   - Specifically, the array `subdirIndexesToCreate` is empty when I check with `console.log`. (Maybe a problem with the `.push()` method?
